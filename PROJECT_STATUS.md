  - Long Neck (camera zoom)
  - Glide (slow fall)
- ✅ Behavior types framework
- ✅ Stat modifier system
- ✅ Mutation timer and expiration

### UI/UX
- ✅ Main menu with start button
- ✅ In-game HUD (score, distance, speed, mutation)
- ✅ Game over screen with retry/menu
- ✅ High score display
- ✅ Responsive design (scales to window)

### Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive PRD (docs/PRD.md)
- ✅ Mutation implementation guide (docs/MUTATIONS_GUIDE.md)
- ✅ README with full project info
- ✅ Quick start guide (QUICKSTART.md)
- ✅ This status document

## 🚧 In Progress / TODO

### MVP Blockers
- ⏳ DNA collectible spawning (system ready, needs implementation)
- ⏳ Mutation pickup mechanic (trigger MutationManager on collect)
- ⏳ Visual assets (currently using colored placeholders)
- ⏳ Sound effects (load/play hooks exist, need audio files)
- ⏳ Mutation visual feedback (sprite swapping, particles)
- ⏳ Balance testing (spawn rates, difficulty curve)

### Nice to Have (MVP)
- ⏳ Touch controls optimization for mobile
- ⏳ Particle effects for destruction
- ⏳ Screen shake on collision
- ⏳ Biome visual themes
- ⏳ Background music

## 🔮 Phase 2 Features (Post-MVP)

### Expansion Ideas
- [ ] Mutation combos (stacking abilities)
- [ ] Multiple biomes with transitions
- [ ] Achievement system
- [ ] Daily challenges
- [ ] Persistent evolution mode
- [ ] Fossil collection archive
- [ ] Cosmetic unlocks
- [ ] Leaderboard (Firebase/Supabase)
- [ ] PWA mobile deployment

## 🎯 MVP Completion Estimate

### Remaining Work
| Task | Estimate | Priority |
|------|----------|----------|
| DNA collectible implementation | 2-3 hours | High |
| Mutation pickup integration | 1-2 hours | High |
| Basic sprites (placeholder art) | 3-4 hours | Medium |
| Sound effects integration | 2 hours | Medium |
| Visual mutation feedback | 2-3 hours | Medium |
| Balance & bug testing | 3-4 hours | High |
| **Total** | **13-18 hours** | |

### Timeline
- **Fast track:** 2-3 days (focused work)
- **Realistic:** 4-5 days (normal pace)
- **Safe:** 1 week (with polish)

## 🚀 Next Immediate Steps

1. **Test the current build**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Implement DNA collectibles**
   - Add spawn logic to ObstacleManager
   - Create DNA sprite group
   - Add collision detection

3. **Connect mutation pickup**
   - Call `mutationManager.applyMutation()` on DNA collect
   - Play pickup sound
   - Show pickup feedback

4. **Add debug mutations**
   - Keyboard shortcuts to test each mutation
   - Verify all 6 mutations work correctly

5. **Create placeholder sprites** (or skip for now)
   - Simple shapes in Piskel
   - 50x70px player sprite
   - 40x40px obstacle sprites

## 📊 Code Quality

### Strengths
✅ Clean separation of concerns (scenes, entities, managers)
✅ Data-driven design (mutations.json)
✅ Extensible architecture (easy to add mutations)
✅ Well-documented code
✅ Modern ES6+ syntax
✅ No hardcoded magic numbers (uses Constants)

### Areas for Improvement
⚠️ No automated tests yet
⚠️ Limited error handling
⚠️ Needs code comments in complex functions
⚠️ Debug mode should be toggleable

## 🎮 Playability

**Current State:** Core loop works, but incomplete
- Player moves and jumps: ✅
- Obstacles spawn and collide: ✅
- Score tracking works: ✅
- Mutations apply but no way to collect: ⚠️
- Game is technically playable: ✅
- Game is fun: 🚧 (needs mutations + polish)

## 🏁 Definition of MVP Complete

The MVP is complete when:
1. [ ] Player can collect DNA to gain mutations
2. [ ] At least 2 mutations work end-to-end
3. [ ] Game is playable for 2+ minutes without crashes
4. [ ] Score and high score track correctly
5. [ ] Basic sound effects play
6. [ ] Game can be deployed (itch.io or GitHub Pages)

## 📝 Notes

- Current build uses placeholder graphics (colored rectangles)
- Mutation system is fully architected but needs integration
- All core systems are in place and working
- Focus should be on connecting DNA pickup → mutation application
- Sound and visual polish can be added last
